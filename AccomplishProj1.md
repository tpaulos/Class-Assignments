## Retrospect on Mybook Project

### What I Accomplish 

* Develop working skill as a team.
* Allow me to search in depth and play around about the subject **React** and styling in React.
  


### What I could have improve

* To add more skills on every angle of the project.
* to learn more about the Github collaboration workflow (updating branch from each team with out affecting the master ....)
* Modify the task beyond the requirement.
* Used flow chart or sudo code at the begning fo the project and dividing the task properly among the team.
